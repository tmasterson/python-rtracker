THis is a simple application that allows for the tracking (checking out and back in) of radio equipment.

The information stored is an item id, which is a unique string and a location or group to whom the equipment has been checked out.
It is setup so that both pieces of information can be entered by scanning qr codes.

It will also allow you to add new equipment and delete equipment as needed.

Both checkout and checkin will allow you to do multiple pieces of equipment at a time with one item per line.

The same is true form the manual add and the import file expects a text file with one item per line.
